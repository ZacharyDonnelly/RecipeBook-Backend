# Back-End & Database for Recipebook

<hr />

## Motivation
This motivation behind this project came out of sheer need for a personalized recipe keeper. While of course
there are great options out there already; I wanted something a little more "my own". Aside from that I wanted a project
that was a little more challenging compared to my others. I wanted to take a different approach to my deployment process as well
as my overall development steps. Overall I am very very happy how the MVP turned out and I plan on introducing new features to this as I go!

### Stack 
Back-End: NodeJS, Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Sequelize(ORM).
Authentication: JWT Cookies, Bcrypt for Hashing/salting. Protected routed based upon active cookie.
Deployment: Docker Containers/Docker-compose, AWS EC2 Instance.
